# Payment-Gateway-Integration-

<b>Hello Everyone!!</b>
I am excited and glad to share my <b>TASK 2</b> given by The Sparks Foundation in  Web Development and Designing Internship.

The Task was to create a Payment Gateway Integration. It is a Corona Relief Fund Donation Website where users can donate money to needy people, which will be then used to donate medicines, food and other important stuffs to survive in this pandemic.

I have used Razorpay as a Payment Gateway and used HTML and CSS for designing the website.

Technology Used: HTML ,CSS.
